# Regression and Classification Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates regression and classification techniques using Python. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of machine learning models to solve both regression and classification problems.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualization of data distributions and relationships.
  - Statistical summaries and insights.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing values.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Feature scaling.

- **Regression Analysis:**
  - Model training and evaluation for predicting continuous outcomes.
  - Performance metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² Score.

- **Classification Analysis:**
  - Implementation of classification models for categorical outcomes.
  - Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.

- **Visualization:**
  - Visual insights into model predictions and evaluation.
